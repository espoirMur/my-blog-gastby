I am an experienced Machine Learning Engineer. I specialized in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer with LLoyd Banking Group in London.

I hold a Master of Science in Big Data and Text Analytics at the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk"> ,University of Essex</a>. I did my dissertation in Open Domain Question Answering for the French Language. I was awarded the Chevening Scholarship by the UK Government's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.

I also enjoy helping young black engineers thrive in their careers, which is why my friends called me: <em>le grand frère de ses petits frères.</em> I am part of the <a href="https://www.masakhane.io/">Masakhane</a>, where I am working on NLP for African/Congolese Language. I am a co-organizer of the <a href="https://francophone-ai-indaba.github.io/">Francophone in AI</a> workshop at the  <a href="https://deeplearningindaba.com">Deep Learning Indaba</a>.

I was born in Bukavu and grew up in Goma, DRCongo. I am the firstborn of a family of nine. 
I define myself as a meloman and enjoy listening to Congolese beats when writing code.
I am a huge Manchester City fan, I play FPL and cycle sometimes.
