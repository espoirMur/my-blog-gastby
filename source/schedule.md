Le grand frere de ses petits frères has set up a booking page for himself.

If you'd like to have a 30 to 45-minute conversation with me, please visit [my booking page](https://cal.com/espoir-murhabazi-fq1lv4) and schedule a session. ⏰

We can discuss anything within my knowledge, such as:

- Career advice: You are a Congolese/African/Black Engineer and  needs guidance on your career and wants to talk to me. 
I can share some stuff I learned during my ten years of Software development experience. 💪🏿
- If you are applying to the Chevening Scholarship, I can give you some tips and hints.. 🎓
- If you plan to relocate to the UK as a professional or student,  I can tell you why the UK may not be the best place to migrate... Lool. 👎
- Anything else that I know and can share with you.

### House rules:

I'll ensure to be punctual, and I kindly ask that you do the same.

The session can be conducted in Swahili, French, English, or Lingala, depending on your preference.
